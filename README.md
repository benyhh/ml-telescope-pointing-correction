# ML Telescope Pointing Model

This project aims to train and test machine learning models for correcting the telescope pointing. It consists of two main experiments: training and testing.

## Experiment 1: Shorter consecutive periods

In this experiment, the data is split into 6 folds. For each fold, the data is further divided into training, validation, and test sets. 


## Experiment 2: Cross-fold Model Evaluation

In this experiment, the data is split into 6 folds. One fold is used for testing, while the remaining 5 folds are used for training and validation. This process is repeated for all six folds to evaluate the performance of the models in a cross-fold manner.
